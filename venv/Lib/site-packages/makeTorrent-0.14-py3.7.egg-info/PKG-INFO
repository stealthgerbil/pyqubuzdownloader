        ===========
        
        
        A basic python library for generating single and multi-file torrents.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Basic usage:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from makeTorrent import makeTorrent
        
            mk = makeTorrent(announce='http://example.com/announce')
        
        
        At this point the makeTorrent class contains a dictionary, which can be printed either as a dict or as a bencoded string (torrent format).
        
        To add files, use either the multi_file class or the single_file class:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            mk.multi_file('/path/to/directory')
        
            with open('my.torrent') as tf:
                tf.write(mk.getBencoded())
        
        The same method can be used with `mk.single_file` with just pointing out a single file.
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        There are a number of items that can be added when initializing the class:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            mk = makeTorrent(
                announce='http://example.com/announce',
                comment='Test Torrent',
                httpseeds=['http://example.com/file.iso'],
                announcelist=[['http://announce1.example.com'],['http://announce2.example.com']]
            )
